2. WHEN I examine the codebase THEN the system SHALL include inline code comments for complex logic
3. WHEN I want to understand the architecture THEN the system SHALL provide architectural documentation
4. WHEN I need API documentation THEN the system SHALL include complete API endpoint documentation
5. WHEN I want to contribute THEN the system SHALL provide contribution guidelines

### Requirement 4: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to perform smoothly with fast load times, so that I have a great user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screens load THEN the system SHALL display content within 2 seconds
2. WHEN animations play THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance
3. WHEN images are loaded THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching and optimization
4. WHEN lists are scrolled THEN the system SHALL use virtualization for large datasets
5. WHEN the app is used THEN the system SHALL have no memory leaks

### Requirement 5: Testing Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can ensure code reliability and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN components are tested THEN the system SHALL include snapshot tests for UI consistency
3. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL verify feature workflows
4. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL complete within 30 seconds
5. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 6: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be secure and my privacy protected, so that I can use the app with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria
